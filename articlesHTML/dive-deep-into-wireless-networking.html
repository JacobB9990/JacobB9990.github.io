            <p>In today&#39;s world, wireless networking has become a crucial component of both personal and
                professional
                environments. Understanding the intricacies of Wireless LAN (WLAN) design and deployment options can
                significantly
                enhance network performance and reliability. This article delves into the considerations for WLAN
                design,
                various
                deployment options, and the underlying theory of wireless communications.</p>
            <h3 id="wlan-design-considerations">WLAN Design Considerations</h3>
            <h4 id="wireless-deployment-options">Wireless Deployment Options</h4>
            <p>When designing a wireless network, selecting the right type of Access Point (AP) is essential. There are
                primarily
                two types of APs to consider: Autonomous and Lightweight.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Autonomous Access Points (APs):</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These are standalone, independent devices.</li>
                        <li>Ideal for home or small office environments.</li>
                        <li>They operate under a controller-less deployment model.</li>
                        <li>Due to their limited scalability, they are not commonly used in large environments.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Lightweight Access Points (APs):</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These require a central Wireless LAN Controller (WLC).</li>
                        <li>Operate under a controller-based deployment model.</li>
                        <li>WLCs can be physical or virtual.</li>
                        <li>The controller manages and communicates changes to the APs.</li>
                        <li>They use the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol, which
                            facilitates
                            communication between APs and the WLC.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="ways-to-deploy">Ways to Deploy</h4>
            <p>There are several deployment models to consider based on network requirements and scale:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Cisco FlexConnect:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Enables configuration and control of remote wireless networks.</li>
                        <li>Similar to Layer 3 roaming with CAPWAP.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Central Switched:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The standard CAPWAP mode of operation.</li>
                        <li>Typically not recommended due to potential performance bottlenecks.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Local Switched:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maps user traffic to a VLAN on an adjacent switch.</li>
                        <li>Control and management traffic are still sent over CAPWAP to the WLC.</li>
                    </ul>

            <p>In a transverse wave:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Electric Field is vertical.</li>
                <li>The Magnetic Field is horizontal.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="how-a-dipole-antenna-radiates-em-waves">How a Dipole Antenna Radiates EM Waves</h4>
            <p>A dipole antenna radiates electromagnetic waves efficiently when the pole is bent rather than straight.
                This
                design
                prevents the positive and negative charges from canceling each other out. The wavelength, represented by
                Lambda (Î»),
                plays a critical role in determining the antenna&#39;s performance.</p>
