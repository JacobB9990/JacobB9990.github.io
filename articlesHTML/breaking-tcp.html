            <h3 id="what-is-transmission-control-protocol">What is Transmission Control Protocol</h3>
            <p>Transmission Control Protocol, known as TCP, is a protocol developed sometime in the 70s. TCP is one part
                of the
                TCP/IP model, specifically at the transport layer. TCP was developed to allow computers to transfer data
                reliably
                and safely. This protocol accomplishes this by using a three-way handshake between the client and the
                host. Once
                this handshake is established they will exchange the data. TCP is very rigorous containing many safety
                checks
                including error detection and correction, sequencing, flow control, congestion control, and
                acknowledgments. So
                breaking TCP is not an easy task.</p>
            <h3 id="how-could-we-break-tcp">How could we &quot;Break&quot; TCP</h3>
            <p>As I stated earlier TCP is rigorous, but that does not mean it is foolproof. There a many ways that you
                could
                potentially go about bringing TCP to its knees. However, this is where I would like to split this
                section into two
                parts: <strong>artificial</strong> and <strong>natural</strong>. Both have their benefits, both have
                their
                negatives. </p>
            <h4 id="artificial">Artificial</h4>
            <p>It is no lie that people have made programs that can simulate poor network connections. Many Linux
                distributions are
                shipped with a command that can replicate these conditions from the get-go. The Linux tool
                &quot;tc&quot;, known as
                Traffic Control, implements traffic delay and loss. This tool is very useful, but honestly, your delay
                is not going
                to stay at 10% all the time. Your delay will often vary depending on many different factors like
                propagation delay,
                transmission delay, processing delay, queuing delay, weather (if Wi-Fi), network topology, interference,
                etc. These
                factors are very hard to represent with a program as all of these issues often are random.</p>
            <h4 id="natural">Natural</h4>
            <p>That brings us to the &quot;natural&quot; part of breaking TCP. As I stated at the end of the
                <strong>Artificial</strong> section, a lot of delay and loss can be random and not replicated through
                some programs.
                This is where you have to get creative. From the factors above we can try our best to make the worst
                conditions
                possible for our networking. Now, I cannot control the weather, but I can try to block the signals from
                reaching the
                router. One way I could do that is by using a Faraday shield, but I do not have access to one of those.
                So, I must
                try to find a corner in my house, or outside, where the wifi connection is not as strong. I can also
                strain the
                network with lots of data like YouTube, more devices, create bottlenecks, etc. I would like to try this
                strategy
                first as honestly it seems like more fun.
