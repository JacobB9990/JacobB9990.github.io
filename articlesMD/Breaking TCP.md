Transmission Control Protocol, known as TCP, is a protocol developed sometime in the 70s. TCP is one part of the TCP/IP model, specifically at the transport layer. TCP was developed to allow computers to transfer data reliably and safely. This protocol accomplishes this by using a three-way handshake between the client and the host. Once this handshake is established they will exchange the data. TCP is very rigorous containing many safety checks including error detection and correction, sequencing, flow control, congestion control, and acknowledgments. So breaking TCP is not an easy task.
