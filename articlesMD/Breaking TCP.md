Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a transport-layer protocol from the 1970s, a part of the TCP/IP model. It ensures reliable data transfer through a three-way handshake between client and host. TCP includes rigorous safet checks, such as error detection, sequencing, flow control, and congestion control, making it challenging to break.
