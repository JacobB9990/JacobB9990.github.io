        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am Jacob. I am studying Computer Science at Misericordia University, focusing on Computer Networking. I've
            always been
            interested in computers since I was young. In high school, I started experimenting with them: I began
            programming, built
            my own PC, and competed in the Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA). I took on Networking
            Infrastructure for the
            first time, reached the state level, and placed 6th. I also did some Roblox scripting using the Luau
            programming
            language and helped a few users with their scripts.
